## Color scheme

The color scheme is encoded in the `color_schemes` field in [`about.json`](./about.json). The semantic meanings of the variables:

- `primary` is the text body color, along with buttons and borders that share the same color as the body text.
- `secondary` is the background color, along with the text color in "light-on-dark" situations, such as a colored button.
- `tertiary` is the accent color, which is used for links, buttons, and notifications.
- `quaternary` is the color of navigation links.
- `header_background` is the color of the header background.
- `header_primary` is the color of the text and icons in the header.
- `highlight` is the color of highlighted elements, such as posts and topics.
- `danger` is the highlight color used for actions relating to deleting posts and topics.
- `success` is used to indicate an action was successful.
- `love` is the color of the like button.
