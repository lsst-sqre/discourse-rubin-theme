# Brand assets

These brand assets are specialized versions or adaptations of the assets in [Rubin Style Dictionary](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/rubin-style-dictionary/tree/main/assets). This README provides some context for these assets and how the originals (typically Adobe Illustrator, `.ai`, documents should be exported.)

For information about how these assets are used with specific Discourse settings, see the base [README](../README.md).

## forum-logo-linear-full.ai

This logo is intended to be used as the site's primary logo as well as the small logo (this Illustrator document has two artboards).

Export as both an SVG (preferred) and PNG 8 (transparent with a height of 240 px to cover retina resolutions).

## forum-logo-linear.ai

_Deprecated_ since the header is now tall enough for the full-scale logo.

## forum-logo-stacked.ai

This logo is intended to be used as the logo in mobile views. It is narrower than the main logo (`forum-logo-linear`) because in mobile views that page is narrower and we need room for the other UI elements in the header bar.

Export as both an SVG (preferred) and PNG (transparent with a height of 220 px to cover retina resolutions).

## large-logo.ai

This is based on the full-sized color-on-white imagotype. Here is it adapted into a 1:1 aspect viewport. This asset is used primarily for social media embeds.

It should be exported as 1024x1024 PNG (the _minimum_ size recommended by Discourse is 512x512).

## push-icon.ai

This asset is used for platform-native push notifications. It is adapted from the intermediate-size gray-on-white imagotype.

Discourse recommends that this icon is monochrome with transparency. The pixel size is 96x96. Export as a PNG.
